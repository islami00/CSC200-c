## Pseudocode for b

<!-- pseudocode isn't strongly typed, hehe -->

```
1. start
2. let n1, n2 and largest
3. enter n1 and n2
4. if n1 is equal to n2 , largest = "neither of the two is greater, the numbers are equal"
5. if n1 > n2 , largest = n1
6. if n2 > n1 , largest = n2
7. print largest
8. end

```

## pseudocode for c

```
1. start
2. let x, sum
3. sum = 0
4. enter x
5. if x >= 1, go to line 9
6. if x = -1 , go to line 11
7. if x < 1 , print "You can only enter positive numbers"
8. go to line 4
9. sum = sum + x
10. go to line 4
11. print sum
12. end
