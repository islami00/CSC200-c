# Notations..

So, apparently, c has these be the same:

Assuming arr is an array of arbitrary size, and i is a pointer to the same data type as arr, then:

1. `*(i + arr)`
2. `*(arr + i)`
3. `arr[i]`
4. `i[arr]`
   All point to the same element.

I.e the code classSamp1.

The general concept to note is that arrays by default decay to a pointer to the first element.
