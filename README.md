# Hi there wanderer!

First off, I'd like to praise you on choosing the vscode path as it is a really slick editor, and...to go straight to the point, I shall now hold your hand to weild this butter knife  

## First things first: how do you get setup?

1. clone this repository
2. Install vscode
3. Open the .workspace file in this folder with vscode
4. Install markdown preview all in one - one of the recommended workspace extensions (Optional - just to allow for notetaking in md and reading this file in vscode)
5. Install the recommended extensions
6. Follow the [setup.md](./setup.md) section corresponding to your os to get `gdb` and `gcc` installed 
7. For `c++` , you'll need `g++` too...but that should be covered in the setup
8. after that, you're all set.
9. Test by opening one of the valid c files in this repo hint: open [this](./h%20a.c) or [that](./proj1/sources/rnd.c) 
10. on opening, run: `ctrl+p` (ctrl poppa) then `>` then type `build` or `tasks` and select `run default build task`, or follow the guide in [setup.md](./setup.md)

Alternatively, you could run: `ctr+shift+p` then `tasks` and select build
Or even quicker: `ctr+shift+B`

Don't you love vscode?


## Remarks

Congrats, and make sure to stay awesome!
Btw: You can delete everything but the .workspace file.
